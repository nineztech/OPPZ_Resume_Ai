# AI Suggestions Fix Guide

## Problem Description
The AI Suggestions feature is currently showing "N/A" values because the Gemini API key is not configured, causing the resume parsing to fail.

## Root Cause
1. **Missing Environment Configuration**: No `.env` file with `GEMINI_API_KEY`
2. **Data Structure Mismatch**: Backend and frontend expect different field names
3. **API Authentication Failure**: Gemini API cannot authenticate without proper credentials

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables
Run the setup script to configure your Gemini API key:

```bash
cd gemini_resume_parser
python setup_env.py
```

This script will:
- Prompt you for your Gemini API key
- Create a `.env` file with proper configuration
- Set up optional parameters (model, file size limits, logging)

### Step 2: Get Your Gemini API Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the key and use it in the setup script

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Test the Setup
```bash
python test_ai_suggestions.py
```

This will verify that:
- Your API key is working
- The Gemini service can connect
- AI suggestions can be generated

### Step 5: Run the Web UI
```bash
python web_ui.py
```

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Data Structure Alignment
- Updated `ai_suggestion_service.py` to use correct field names (`basic_details` instead of `basic_info`)
- Fixed field mappings for experience, education, projects, and certifications
- Aligned backend response format with frontend expectations

### 2. Job Description Generation
- Changed from returning plain text to structured JSON
- Added proper field names: `jobTitle`, `experienceLevel`, `salaryRange`, etc.
- Improved prompt engineering for consistent output

### 3. AI Suggestions Response Format
- Updated response structure to match frontend expectations
- Added `overallScore`, `atsCompatibility`, `skillsAnalysis` fields
- Improved error handling and validation

## Expected Results

After fixing the configuration, you should see:

✅ **Overall Score**: A percentage score (e.g., 85%)
✅ **Job Description**: Properly formatted with title, experience level, salary range
✅ **ATS Compatibility**: Detailed analysis with strengths and improvements
✅ **Skills Analysis**: Matching and missing skills identified
✅ **Actionable Suggestions**: Specific recommendations for improvement

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing "N/A"?
1. Check that `.env` file exists and contains valid API key
2. Verify API key is not expired or rate-limited
3. Check console logs for error messages
4. Run `test_ai_suggestions.py` to isolate the issue

### API Errors?
1. Ensure you have internet connection
2. Check if Gemini API is available in your region
3. Verify API key permissions and quotas
4. Check the logs for specific error messages

### Frontend Issues?
1. Ensure backend is running on correct port
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify CORS settings if testing from different domain

## File Changes Made

- `services/ai_suggestion_service.py`: Fixed data structure handling and response format
- `setup_env.py`: New setup script for environment configuration
- `test_ai_suggestions.py`: New test script to verify functionality
- `AI_SUGGESTIONS_FIX.md`: This documentation file

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Run setup and test scripts to get AI suggestions working
2. **Short-term**: Test with real resumes to ensure quality
3. **Long-term**: Consider adding more AI models or improving prompt engineering

## Support

If you continue to have issues:
1. Check the logs in the web UI console
2. Run the test scripts to isolate problems
3. Verify your Gemini API key is working
4. Check the [Gemini API documentation](https://ai.google.dev/docs) for updates
